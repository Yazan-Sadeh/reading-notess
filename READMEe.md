The Git project is an open source programming project, and it is available for download on computers. It allows the creation and retrieval of projects. It also allows creating a copy of the repository. The local repository depends on three components: the work guide, the index, and the address. It also allows the changes to be saved to all files in the checked out copies of the project file.

** *Also, the life cycle of the file, where in the event that it is modified, Git allows the modified files to be arranged and make interim changes, for example when checking the status of the file (git status) you must use the ($ git) command, and there is a system for tracking and organizing the new file using the following format git add filename, All files can be tracked by adding ( $). These commands have the function of tracking and arranging files. Changes can also be hidden, and this is a good option when the person is not ready to make changes.

** **_ _In order to cooperate in Git projects, you must interact with remote repositories and with existing projects on the Internet. It is also possible to work with multiple projects, as you can get specific privileges such as reading, writing. The team can use remote warehouses to send information and withdraw data from them, and special remote control devices can be seen, examples of this are:

$ cd example $ git remote -v remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (fetch) remote1 https://github.com/remote1/example (push) remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (fetch) remote2 https://github.com/remote2/example (push) remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (fetch) remote3 https://github.com/remote3/example (push)
